            <p>My summer training was done in Classera, which has built an innovative
                and integrated educational system and platforms to provide its partners with
                the best educational services. Classera was chosen because we wanted to learn
                new skills that would help us decide on the line of work we wanted to pursue
                and because we also wanted to experience a real work environment that was
                different from attending classes or working in the same place studying. My
                team consisted of 4 members and all of them from the CS department, we
                were working on a blog website with 5 types of users on the website. the
                website allows users to add, edit, and delete posts. and add, edit, and delete
                groups. also, users from the same group can add a comment and like posts.
                The tools that were used to program the website are PHP and MySQL.</p>
